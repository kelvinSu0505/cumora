 * survived a reload on either shell. Drafts now live in the store (one mount
 * boundary can't destroy them) and mirror to localStorage (a restart can't
 * either).
 *
 * Kept in its own module so the policy — what a draft is, how many we keep,
 * how big the mirror may get — is testable without a store or a DOM.
